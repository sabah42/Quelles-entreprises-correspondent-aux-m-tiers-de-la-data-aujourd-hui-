# ðŸ“Š Project Summary: "Which Companies Fit Data Jobs Today?"
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the French job market for Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers, by studying the characteristics of companies offering these positions.
We investigated which company profiles are best suited to each data role, providing guidance for both companies and job seekers in the data field.

## Data Acquisition
Data were collected from:

LinkedIn (job postings for Data roles)

Societe.fr (company size, sector, employee count)

BFM Verif (financial data: revenue, operating expenses, salaries)

Market Analysis
432 job offers from 102 companies were analyzed.

Data Analysts were the most demanded profile, mainly on permanent contracts (CDI).

The consulting and IT sectors, particularly in Paris, dominate the demand for data jobs.

## Company Characteristics
Financial and structural data were analyzed.

There is no strong direct link between a company's financial health and the number of data job offers.

However, larger companies tend to have specific needs, while smaller ones seek versatile profiles.

## Clustering & Modeling
Two machine learning algorithms were used to group companies:

K-Means clustering (optimal number of clusters: 3)

Hierarchical Clustering (dendrograms)

## Clusters showed:

Small companies prefer Data Analysts.

Medium companies prefer versatile Data Scientists.

Large companies seek Data Engineers for specialized tasks.

## Results & Insights
The market offers a balanced distribution between the three roles.

The company size influences the type of data profile they hire.

A dashboard was built to visualize and interact with all the findings.

## Conclusion
Using unsupervised machine learning models, we segmented companies into meaningful groups.
This project provides valuable insights for data professionals to target companies that best match their skills.
